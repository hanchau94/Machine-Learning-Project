Welcome to our project focusing on assessing CO2 emissions from gasoline-powered light-duty vehicles to determine if they exceed predefined thresholds. In an era where environmental sustainability is paramount, understanding and regulating vehicle emissions are critical. Leveraging machine learning techniques, our project analyzes vehicle data to predict CO2 emissions and compare them against specified thresholds. By accurately identifying vehicles exceeding these thresholds, we aim to aid regulatory efforts and promote cleaner transportation practices. Explore our repository to delve into our methodology, datasets, and results, and join us in our mission to mitigate the environmental impact of vehicle emissions.
